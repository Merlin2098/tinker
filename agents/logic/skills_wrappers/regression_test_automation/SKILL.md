# SKILL.md - regression_test_automation

This is an auto-generated compatibility wrapper.
Source of truth remains in the Tinker framework paths listed below.

## Skill Identity
- Name: `regression_test_automation`
- Tier: `lazy`
- Cluster: `python_quality`
- Priority: `63`
- Purpose: Automated regression testing workflow with baseline capture, targeted suites, and stability checks

## Source Files
- Body (Layer 3): `agents/logic/skills/python/regression_test_automation.md`
- Metadata (Layer 2): `agents/logic/skills/python/regression_test_automation.meta.yaml`
- Index (Layer 1): `agents/logic/skills/_index.yaml`
- Trigger rules: `agents/logic/skills/_trigger_engine.yaml`

## Execution Contract
1. Use this wrapper only as an entry point for compatibility.
2. Load Layer 2 and Layer 3 from the source files above.
3. Do not treat this wrapper as authoritative if source files disagree.
4. If source files are missing, report and continue with best-effort fallback.

## Maintenance
- Generated by: `agents/hooks/generate_skill_wrappers.py`
- Generated deterministically from: `agents/logic/skills/_index.yaml`
- Do not edit manually. Regenerate instead.
