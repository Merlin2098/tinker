# SKILL.md - ambiguity_escalation

This is an auto-generated compatibility wrapper.
Source of truth remains in the Tinker framework paths listed below.

## Skill Identity
- Name: `ambiguity_escalation`
- Tier: `core`
- Cluster: `governance`
- Priority: `94`
- Purpose: Escalates unclear requirements instead of guessing

## Source Files
- Body (Layer 3): `agents/logic/skills/governance/ambiguity_escalation.md`
- Metadata (Layer 2): `agents/logic/skills/governance/ambiguity_escalation.meta.yaml`
- Index (Layer 1): `agents/logic/skills/_index.yaml`
- Trigger rules: `agents/logic/skills/_trigger_engine.yaml`

## Execution Contract
1. Use this wrapper only as an entry point for compatibility.
2. Load Layer 2 and Layer 3 from the source files above.
3. Do not treat this wrapper as authoritative if source files disagree.
4. If source files are missing, report and continue with best-effort fallback.

## Maintenance
- Generated by: `agents/tools/generate_skill_wrappers.py`
- Generated deterministically from: `agents/logic/skills/_index.yaml`
- Do not edit manually. Regenerate instead.
