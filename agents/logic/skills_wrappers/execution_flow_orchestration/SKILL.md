This is an auto-generated compatibility wrapper.
Source of truth remains in the Tinker framework paths listed below.

## Skill Identity
- Name: `execution_flow_orchestration`
- Tier: `core`
- Cluster: `execution_pipeline`
- Priority: `86`
- Purpose: Structured execution with atomic actions, progress monitoring, failure handling

## Source Files

- Index (Layer 1): `agents/logic/skills/_index.yaml`
- Trigger rules: `agents/logic/skills/_trigger_engine.yaml`

## Execution Contract
1. Use this wrapper only as an entry point for compatibility.
2. Load Layer 2 and Layer 3 from the source files above.
3. Do not treat this wrapper as authoritative if source files disagree.
4. If source files are missing, report and continue with best-effort fallback.

## Maintenance
- Generated by: `agents/hooks/generate_skill_wrappers.py`
