This is an auto-generated compatibility wrapper.
Source of truth remains in the Invoker framework paths listed below.

## Skill Identity
- Name: `api_client_generator`
- Tier: `lazy`
- Cluster: `python_quality`
- Priority: `45`
- Purpose: Type-safe API clients for REST/GraphQL

- Metadata (Layer 2): `(not found)`
- Index (Layer 1): `agent/skills/_index.yaml`
- Trigger rules: `agent/skills/_trigger_engine.yaml`

## Execution Contract

4. If source files are missing, report and continue with best-effort fallback.
