# SKILL.md - skill_builder

This is an auto-generated compatibility wrapper.
Source of truth remains in the Tinker framework paths listed below.

## Skill Identity
- Name: `skill_builder`
- Tier: `core`
- Cluster: `meta`
- Priority: `95`
- Purpose: Allows the agent to self-improve by creating and registering new skills.

## Source Files
- Body (Layer 3): `agent/skills/meta/skill_builder.md`
- Metadata (Layer 2): `agent/skills/meta/skill_builder.meta.yaml`
- Index (Layer 1): `agent/skills/_index.yaml`
- Trigger rules: `agent/skills/_trigger_engine.yaml`

## Execution Contract
1. Use this wrapper only as an entry point for compatibility.
2. Load Layer 2 and Layer 3 from the source files above.
3. Do not treat this wrapper as authoritative if source files disagree.
4. If source files are missing, report and continue with best-effort fallback.

## Maintenance
- Generated by: `agent_tools/generate_skill_wrappers.py`
- Generated deterministically from: `agent/skills/_index.yaml`
- Do not edit manually. Regenerate instead.
