# SKILL.md - ui_application_assets

This is an auto-generated compatibility wrapper.
Source of truth remains in the Invoker framework paths listed below.

## Skill Identity
- Name: `ui_application_assets`
- Tier: `lazy`
- Cluster: `ui`
- Priority: `45`
- Purpose: Centralized asset management (icons, images)

## Source Files
- Body (Layer 3): `agent/skills/ui/ui_application_assets.md`
- Metadata (Layer 2): `(not found)`
- Index (Layer 1): `agent/skills/_index.yaml`
- Trigger rules: `agent/skills/_trigger_engine.yaml`

## Execution Contract
1. Use this wrapper only as an entry point for compatibility.
2. Load Layer 2 and Layer 3 from the source files above.
3. Do not treat this wrapper as authoritative if source files disagree.
4. If source files are missing, report and continue with best-effort fallback.

## Maintenance

- Generated deterministically from: `agent/skills/_index.yaml`
- Do not edit manually. Regenerate instead.
