# Governance Rules Index

## Canonical Source
- `agent/rules/agent_rules.md` is the single authoritative governance policy document.

## Scope of Other Files
- Other files in this folder are non-canonical helpers:
  - operational checklists
  - compatibility notes
  - diagnostic heuristics
- If any helper conflicts with `agent_rules.md`, `agent_rules.md` wins.

## Enforcement Priority
1. `agent/rules/agent_rules.md`
2. Agent contract files
3. Runtime constraints
