# claude.md Clarification (Compatibility Note)

This file is non-canonical governance guidance.

## Canonical Governance
- `agent/rules/agent_rules.md` is authoritative.

## Clarification
- `claude.md`-style artifacts are optional bootstrap aids.
- They do not replace schema validation, protected-file enforcement, or runtime constraints.
- Runtime behavior must remain valid even if external prompt files are missing.
