# UI Skills

Reusable UI behavior patterns for building professional, responsive desktop applications.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `ui_framework_selection` | Selects Tkinter for MVP prototypes or PySide6 for production builds |
| `ui_widget_modularity` | Creates self-contained, reusable widgets decoupled from global layout |
| `ui_theme_binding` | Implements reactive theme systems with automatic widget updates |
| `ui_layout_proportionality` | Builds adaptive, proportional layouts for multiple resolutions |
| `ui_identity_policy` | Displays application identity without redundant information |
| `ui_splash_and_lazy_loading` | Shows splash screens during lazy resource loading |
| `ui_application_assets` | Manages centralized, cross-platform application assets |

## Design Principles

These skills enforce:
- **Modularity**: Widgets are self-contained and composable
- **Responsiveness**: Layouts adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions
- **Professionalism**: Clean identity presentation and polished user experience
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and efficient resource management
- **Maintainability**: Centralized theming and asset management
- **Cross-platform**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Usage

Each skill is independent and can be applied as needed. Skills are purely operational and contain no agent role logic.
